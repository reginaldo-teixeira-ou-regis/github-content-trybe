# Day 1 - Contents: 

* How States is used in the React Applications; 
* Components with `States` and `Events`; 
* `Classes` in React are defined with `class MyClass extends React.Component`; 
* Function `constructor()`; 
* Function `super()`; 
* Function `render()`; 
* The `this` inside React component classes is a huge `object`, which basically contains everything; 
* When we do `this.props`, we are accessing the `props` `key` inside the `this` object; 
* When defining a `function of the class` with an `arrow function` you don't need to do the `bind`; 
* `Modifying` the component's `state`; 
* The State is `updated` in an `asynchronous` way by React through the function `this.setState(myNewObjectRepresentsTheState)`; 
* Setting the `initial state` through of `Public Class Fields`; 
* `State` vs `Props`; 
* `props` - basically passes `data` from `parent` to `child`; 
* `state` - is reserved for `data` your component `controls`;
