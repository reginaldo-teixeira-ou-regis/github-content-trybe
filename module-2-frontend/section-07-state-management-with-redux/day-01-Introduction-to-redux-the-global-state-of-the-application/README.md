# Day 1 - Contents: 

* Parts of Redux; 
* Concepts of the Redux - `store`, `reducer` and `actions`; 
* The function to read the state - `getState()`; 
* The function to write the state - `dispatch()`; 
* Creating the Global State - Store; 
* The function `createStore()`; 
* The `reducer` is the function responsible for writing to the `Global State`; 
* An `action` is nothing more than an `object` that has compulsorily the key `type`; 
* To send an `action` to the `reducer` it is necessary to pass it as `argument` to the function `dispatch()`; 
* To read the `Global State`, the `store` object makes available the function `getState()`; 
* The `store` object also makes available the function `subscribe()`; 
* What about the `Redux Toolkit` (RTK)?; 
* Extension `Redux DevTools`; 
* Using the Redux in Practice;
