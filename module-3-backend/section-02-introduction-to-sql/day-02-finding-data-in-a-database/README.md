* `Query` is the name given to `commands` that you `type` into a `window or command line` with the intention of `interacting` in some way with a `database`; 
* `DDL` (Data Definition Language) are `all the commands` that deal with the `schema`, description and how data should exist in a database: 
* - We use the `CREATE` command to create databases, tables, indexes, views, procedures, functions and triggers; 
* - We use the `ALTER` command to change the structure of any object; 
* - We use the `DROP` command to delete objects; 
* - We use the `TRUNCATE` command to just `empty the data` inside a table but keep it in the database; 
* `DML` (Data Manipulation Language) are used to `store`, `modify`, `search` and `delete` data in a `database` and the `most common commands and uses` in this category are: 
* - The `SELECT` command is used to `fetch data` from a database; 
* - The `INSERT` command inserts data into a table; 
* - The `UPDATE` command changes data within a table; 
* - The `DELETE` command deletes data from a table; 
* `DCL` (Data Control Language) is more focused on `commands that grant rights`, `permissions` and other `types of control` to the database system, such as: 
* - The `GRANT` command grants access to a user; 
* - The `REVOKE` command removes access granted through the `GRANT` command;
